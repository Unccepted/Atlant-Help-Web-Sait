# Atlant-Help-Web-Site

This project I had been creating thins 06.06.22 till 30.08.22. It was my first, truly first, attempt to create a website for a charity foundation and prove my skills.
When I start to program, I already had experience in this topic. Previously I created something similar to this, but I ended up showing the data from the database in localhost.
This time I push myself even further and publish my website on the Internet using www.smarterasp.net. 
Right now I want to recreate this website using React.js and also recreate the design.
